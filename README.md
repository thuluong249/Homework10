Description
📜📜

This application is to help development team to quickly generate team in the HTML format that displays the team's basic information. 

The application runs at the command prompt and when executed it will take the user through a series of command prompt questions to get user input. There are three types of team members: manager, engineer, and intern.

For the manager the prompts are asking the user to input for the manager's name, employee ID number, email address and the office number.

For team engineers the prompts are asking the user to input the engineer's name, employee ID number, email address, and the Github username.

For the intern, the prompts are asking the user to input the intern's name, employee ID number, email address, and the intern's school name.

The user will input information for one manager and as many engineers and interns as needed.

The application uses these input to generate a HTML file and will display the roster in the order the user inputs them.
